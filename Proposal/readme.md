# <ins>Project Proposal Phase 1

## **<ins>1.0 Introduction**
Nowadays , technology has become a dominant part of everyone’s life . making our life more productive and easier . So it would not come to anyone's surprise that the world is moving towards technological advancement and so is our university . UTM's future campus vision is just an example of the effort being put towards achieving this goal .

However, despite the advancements in technology, students at our campus continue to face challenges in accessing timely information about various clubs and societies. The current methods of communication, such as campus group messages, are full of commercial spam, making it challenging for students to find information regarding clubs , events and other co-curricular activities. Additionally, many clubs lack exposure, further exacerbating the issue and hindering students' ability to explore and engage in extracurricular activities effectively.

To address these challenges, our team has embarked on a project planning approach to develop innovative solutions that enhance the accessibility and visibility of club and society information for all students . By leveraging project planning methodologies, we aim to develop a user-friendly platform that offers students in UTM , seamless access to a wealth of club information, empowering them to discover, explore, and engage in extracurricular activities with ease. Additionally, our platform simplifies the lives of organizers by streamlining event registration and certificate awarding processes, all within one cohesive space.

In this proposal, we will outline our plans for the development of the current system, focusing on enhancing user experience, improving information channels, and increasing engagement among students. Our approach will involve conducting thorough research to understand the specific needs and preferences of our target audience. We will then design and implement features that address these needs, ensuring that the platform is intuitive, user-friendly, and effective in facilitating communication between clubs and students.

## **<ins>3.0 Problem Statement**
### 1. Problem 1: Campus group messages are flooded with spam
Event details obtained from social media groups are often time consuming and unsatisfactory as it is often flooded with spams and advertisements, causing students to miss some of the important event promotions. Too many social media groups that are requested for students to join shares the same information and spam messages that causes students to take much time in identifying useful information.

### 2. Problem 2: Uncentralized platform for communication of information 
Many school announcements and information are communicated through the same social media group that is being used as the means to promote club events, at the same time advertising for student businesses. This creates a confusing situation for students when they come across different types of information in the same group and makes it difficult to trace back certain useful information about club events in the future. 

### 3. Problem 3: Lack of exposure to niche clubs
As information fails to reach students on a daily basis through social media groups, it is almost certain that a lot of smaller clubs and societies might not be able to get much event information out when they’re hosting an event. The lack of exposure for these clubs is also a key reason why many students are not able to join the events hosted around campus as they are not aware of the existence of these clubs.
