## **ClubHub**

A user-friendly platform that offers students in UTM , seamless access to a wealth of club information, empowering them to discover, explore, and engage in extracurricular activities with ease.

## Introduction
Students at our campus face challenges in accessing timely information about various clubs and societies, hindering their ability to explore and engage in extracurricular activities. The campus group messages, intended for communication, are flooded with commercial spam, making it difficult for students to find relevant club information.  Additionally, there is a lack of exposure for many clubs, making it challenging for students to discover the diverse options available on campus. To address these issues, Clubhub has been proposed as a centralized platform designed to revolutionize the way students discover, communicate, and participate in campus clubs and events.

## Problem Statement
### 1. Campus group messages are flooded with spam
- Time consuming and unsatisfactory 
- Causes students to miss  important event promotions
- Shares the same information and spam messages

### 2. Uncentralized platform for communication of information
- Creates a confusing situation 
- Difficult to trace back certain useful information

### 3. Lack of exposure to niche clubs
- A lot of smaller clubs might not be able to get much event information out
- Many students are not  aware of the existence of these clubs.

## Final Solution
### 1. Centralized platform
-Solely purposed for promoting diverse events and activities
-Reduces the burden of navigating through multiple social media groups and channels.
-Minimizes the likelihood of missing important event promotions.
### 2. User-Friendly
- Publish details of events 
- Ensures ease of use and accessibility.

- Provides users with relevant, non-spammy information.
### 3. Dedicated Club Sections

- Empowers students to make informed decisions about which clubs to join.
### 4. Event Records Repository
